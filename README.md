Project Title - Clinic Booking & Patient Management System
Project Description:

This project models a real-world clinic management system using SQL. It handles:
- Patient Registration
- Doctor Management
- Booking Appointments
- Tracking Treatments

The system ensures:
- Only registered patients can book appointments.
- Each appointment is linked to one doctor and one patient.
- Treatments are directly tied to appointments (1-to-1).

It demonstrates data normalization (up to 3NF) and uses proper relational constraints like PK, FK, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE.

 How to Run or Setup the Project

1. Open a SQL client like:
   - MySQL Workbench
   - phpMyAdmin
   - pgAdmin (if using PostgreSQL)
   - SQLite Browser (if modifying to SQLite)

2. Create a new database:
sql
CREATE DATABASE clinic_db;
USE clinic_db;


3. Run the SQL script file containing the schema:
sql
-- Paste or import the CREATE TABLE statements here


4. Optionally insert sample data for testing.
